name:The Hierophant
pastUpright:You come from a traditional and perhaps religious family background, which has given you a true sense of belonging and shared values with others. Or it could be that religion and spirituality played an important part in your life in the recent past, whether through education or belonging to a religious institution. In the upright position, the Hierophant provides community and safety from a sense of belonging.
pastReverse:However, in the reversed position, this Major Arcana card can indicate dogma or closed-mindedness. If you recently moved away from a situation that was intolerant or judgemental, you discovered that you are your own teacher! You trust your own instincts and were brave enough to forge your own path.
presentUpright:Are you exploring a new spiritual group or community? Although you might be leaving behind some individuality, this new sense of belonging will open up new doors for you. Through regular spiritual practice, the mysteries of the universe will gradually be revealed to you.
presentReverse:The Hierophant in reverse could be warning you that you’re currently involved with a spiritual community that is tending toward dogma and intolerance. Although we can learn a lot from tradition and society, we must never lose our individuality. Always use your own judgement, and if something feels wrong, listen to your intuition and maintain your values.
futureUpright:It looks like you will be developing a relationship with a spiritual guide or mentor in the near future. This wise teacher will support you in your personal spiritual evolution, and you will be able to join a cause that’s greater than yourself.
futureReverse:If this tarot card is reversed, be on the lookout for someone who wants to use religious doctrine or dogma to influence or control you. Stay connected to your core values and beliefs and you won’t be led astray.
